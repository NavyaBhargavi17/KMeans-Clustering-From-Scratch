# K-Means Clustering (From Scratch)

This project implements **K-Means Clustering from scratch** in Python using only NumPy and Matplotlib. It also uses `make_blobs` to generate synthetic 2D data.

---

## ðŸ“Œ What is K-Means?
K-Means is an **unsupervised learning algorithm** used to group similar data into clusters. It works by:
1. Randomly selecting `k` centroids.
2. Assigning each data point to the nearest centroid.
3. Recalculating centroids based on the mean of the cluster.
4. Repeating steps until convergence.
